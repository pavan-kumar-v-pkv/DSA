// Given are the two distinct words startWord and targetWord, and a list of 
// size N, denoting wordList of unique words of equal size M. Find the length 
// of the shortest transformation sequence from startWord to targetWord.

// Keep the following conditions in mind:
// * A word can only consist of lowercase characters.
// * Only one letter can be changed in each transformation.
// * Each transformed word must exist in the wordList including the targetWord.
// * startWord may or may not be part of the wordList

// Note: If thereâ€™s no possible way to transform the sequence from startWord 
// to targetWord return 0.
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// how is this a graph problem ?
// beginWord = "hit"  
// endWord   = "cog"  
// wordList  = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]  

// Output: 5  
// (hit â†’ hot â†’ dot â†’ dog â†’ cog)
// Think of each word as a node (vertex) in a graph.
// There is an edge between two words if they differ by exactly one letter.
// So in the above example:
// * "hit" is connected to "hot"
// * "hot" is connected to "dot" and "lot"
// * "dot" is connected to "dog", etc.
// Once you model it this way, the problem becomes:
// ðŸ‘‰ Find the shortest path in an unweighted graph from beginWord to endWord.

// What Graph Algorithm to use?
// Since edges are unweighted (changing one letter has the same cost), the correct choice is:
// *Breadth-First Search (BFS)
// BFS ensures that the first time you reach the endWord, itâ€™s via the shortest path (minimum transformations).

// time: O(N*M*26)
// space: O(N)
