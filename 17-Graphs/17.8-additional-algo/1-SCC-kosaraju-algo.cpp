// You are given a directed graph with V vertices, numbered from 0 to V âˆ’ 1, and its adjacency list Adj, where 
// Adj[i] contains all vertices j such that there is a directed edge from vertex i to vertex j.

// Your task is to find the number of strongly connected components (SCCs) in the graph.
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// What is meant by Strongly Connected Component (SCC)?
// A component is called a Strongly Connected Component(SCC) only if for every possible pair of vertices (u, v) 
// inside that component, u is reachable from v and v is reachable from u.
// Note: Strongly connected components(SCC) are only valid for directed graphs.

// Kosaraju's Algorithm:
// 1. Sort all the nodes according to their finishing time: Perform a DFS call to sort the nodes based on their 
// finishing time and store them in a stack.
// 2. Reverse all the edges of the entire graph: Create a new graph where all the edges of the original graph 
// will be reversed.
// 3. Perform the DFS and count the number of different DFS calls to get the number of SCC: Start DFS traversal 
// on the reversed graph from the node which is on the top of the stack and continue until the stack becomes empty. 
// For each DFS call, the counter representing the number of SCCs can be incremented by 1.
